## Overview

In this project, I developed a flexible and scalable design system using a BootStrap like scss for front-end development, Web components, and Readme and Website documentation, on Github for easy collaboration. The goal was to create a reusable component library that not only adheres to consistent design principles but is also easily extendable for future needs. The design system was aimed at improving the overall developer experience while maintaining visual consistency across multiple projects.

## Our problem statements

- **Increase Engagement**: I spearheaded initiatives to enhance engagement by leveraging the power of gaming within our learning modules. We used the SPA template including the tally, toast, button, and modal web components to pull it all together.
- **Update look and feel**: We had a full rebrand and created a copacetic aligned approach.
- **Use the newest tools**: The framework and js libraries that we were using are no being kept up and we had the opportunity to test drive the
  latest L&K web components. Which also have built-in accessibility compliance.
- **No version control, lots of overwriting issues**: The old way of working was you had to copy files you are editing to computer folder then add them to the backup/previous on remote to backup them. Then make some edits and put on server to test. Continue making blind changes and reviewing on server. Once changes are approved you can put the changes into the main directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Components + js**: For fast, reusable, custom elements, that use the shadow DOM and HTML templates speeding up loading times and removing code collision issues.
- **Github**: For documention, creating, managing code assets, and templates.
- **Deploy Manager + Gulp**: Automate file cleaning, minification, and bundling with Gulp for efficient deployment with the new Deploy Manager tool.
- **Readme + Github templates**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

No version control or standardized templates.

We started the project without any
standardization. I created a template
with L&K web components and a
responsive CSS framework. The team
had constant issues with overwriting
code. Embracing version control
benefits collaboration while utilizing
GitHub for repositories.

My role was to create reusable
templates and document how to run on
your local and knowledge share how to
use GitHub properly.

## Outcome

**Best Practices**
Revolutionize Your Development Workflow: From overwriting woes to seamless GitHub powered solutions
**Games + Enhanced Engagement**
By thinking up new ways to use
these components we achieved
our goal of creating a fun and
exciting new game for the
Consulting Academy
