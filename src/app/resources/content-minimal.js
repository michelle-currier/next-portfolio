          Michelle Currier has over a decade of professional expertise, they
          seamlessly integrate a formal foundation in print, web, and graphic
          design with a proven track record of accomplishments in Software as a
          Service (SaaS) and app development. Their specializations crosscut
          video editing, DJing, Front-end development, and UX/UI design,
          reflecting a comprehensive skill set and a history of success in
          crafting engaging and user-friendly digital experiences.

        <p>
          My work spans a diverse range of disciplines, from crafting{" "}
          <Link href="/work">intuitive digital interfaces</Link> to designing
          immersive interactive experiences. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the
          intersection of design and engineering, where aesthetics meet
          functionality. I believe that the best solutions arise from a balance
          of creativity and technical rigor, and I enjoy the challenge of
          finding that balance in every project I undertake.

            During my tenure with the Consulting Academy, my efforts have
            extended to fostering proficient usage of Github and the deploy

            notable reduction in code overwriting instances, and we have now
            established robust best practices for code management.
